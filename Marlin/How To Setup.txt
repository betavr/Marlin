There are pre setup configurations files for the A10-A20+ and other variants in the other configuration folder replace the configuration.h in the marlin folder with the one you need. 
once the configuration you want is in place open marlin.ino in the latest arduino ide and run a verify first then in tools check that your printer port is selected. 
for the flash process be sure to close any other program that controls the printer failure to do so can brick the printer. 
then click upload it will compile again then avrdude should show a loading bar once avrdude says thankyou flashing is complete.
now from the lcd in commands clean eeprom.

Disclaimer: Use at your own risk i take no responsibility for anything.
There is a risk in flashing firmware to the board if anything interrupts it will brick the board.
(((Marlin 2.0 is not released its still beta some features are not complete.)))
bugs should be reported to marlin directly (The things i cant fix)

Known Issues:
Multi material - no mix menu, multi colour models have to be designed.
power loss resume - broken
UBL - has crashing issue.

To keep things simpler there is one download that has "other config's" you can copy paste in.
the default config is the one for my test machine.
supported models: A10+m+bltouch+tmc2208 A20+m+bltouch+tmc2208
Running Pid autotune is suggested you may trigger runaway if you don't.
Calibrating your steps is suggested it can vary machine to machine.

Be sure to clean the EEPROM after every flash to correct the crc mismatch.
Newest versions will be placed here keep an eye on build#.
The source for this firmware came direct from the marlin GitHub i setup and tested .
GT2560 V3 & GT2560 Rev B work with the firmware but you may need to turn off the filament sensor in the menu.
Compiled with arduino IDE 1.8.8 older may not work.
U8glib is a required dependency library for a20 & a20m 
Throw all of your expectations from V1 out the window V2 is less and less like stock every Build.

Build Tags
Nightly - untested daily build
Stable - fully tested build
